# Vector package template

## Structure

In order to share a custom script package for your Vector Robot, you will need to follow a simple structure like this :


```
.
├── extra_folder
│   └── sample_extra_helper.py
├── LICENSE
├── myscript.py
└── README.md
```


Here :

  * **myscript.py** is the entrypoint to launch script
  * **LICENSE** is the license type for the use of your script
  * **README.md** is the markdown descriptive and instructions document to use your script


## Versionning


You will need to tag your github project, otherwise you won't be able to share it. There is no restrictions about how
you want to set your version numbering rules.
